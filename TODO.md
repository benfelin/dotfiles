# Work In Progress

- tmux-reset.sh : GNU v. BSD sed

# Last issues

# Some rules

- As POSIX as possible : scripts using the Bourne shell (#!/bin/sh). When bash is required
then use '#!/usr/bin/env bash'

# OS branch

- git: prompt and auto-complete are installed (or not eg. openbsd) differently for each OS
